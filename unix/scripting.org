NOTE: You have created a script called `newscript` that accepts a file name
and creates a script template with that name in the current directory. It even
adds executable permissions to it, so all you have to do is edit the file and 
run it.

Create a file that looks like this:
```
  #!/bin/bash
  # My first script

  echo "Hello World!"
```
Then use `chmod +x {filename}` or `chmod 755 {filename}` to give you 
execute permissions.

To make a script available from anywhere, its directory must be added to PATH. 
This can be done with the command `export PATH=$PATH:{directory}`. However,
this only adds it to the path for the current bash session. To permanently
add it, add the same command to your `.bash_profile`.

If you've done this before, you should have a /bin directory located at 
~/bin/ -- Just add your script in there and it will be accessible from 
anywhere.
